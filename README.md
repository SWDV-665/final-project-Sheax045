My mobile app idea is based off of a friends brand/business. She currently runs a business called Duluth Loves Local which 
highlights local businesses and encourages people to shop local. She also runs and hosts events throughout the year in Duluth, 
Minnesota. Currently, she uses Instagram to get information out to her followers. A mobile app is a great way to engage followers 
and the rest of the community. Basically, the app would showcase local businesses and highlight the area for tourism. The app 
uses the Google Maps Cordova Native plugin to list events and gives the location of the events and businesses. 
Also, the app will use MongoDB for an email subscribers list.
